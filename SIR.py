"""
Simulates the spread of a cyber threat (via Spam attacks) using the SIR model, with the infection rate adjusted based on 
the forecasted spam attack probability using an ARIMA model.

Functions:
    sir_model(y, t, beta, gamma): Defines the SIR model dynamics.
    
Workflow:
   
1. Defines the SIR model function `sir_model`:
    - Takes the current values for susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) populations.
    - Uses infection rate (beta) and recovery rate (gamma) to calculate the rate of change for each population.

2. Loads cyber threat data (`cyber_data.csv`) and filters data for selected countries.
    - Selected countries include: Republic of India, Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, 
      Kingdom of Bhutan, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

3. For each country:
    - Extracts the spam attack probability data.
    - Uses `auto_arima` to automatically select the best ARIMA model to forecast the next spam probability.
    - Adjusts the infection rate (`beta`) in the SIR model based on the ARIMA forecast.
    - Solves the SIR model equations to get the time evolution of susceptible, infected, and recovered populations over 60 months.

4. Results are stored in the `results` dictionary, which contains the susceptible, infected, and recovered populations for each country.

5. Finally, the results are plotted:
    - For each country, it plots the probability of being infected over time.
    - The plot title, labels, and grid are set accordingly for visualization.

Parameters:
    data (pd.DataFrame): Cyber threat data, containing spam attack probabilities for different countries.
    nearby_countries (list): A list of selected countries for which the analysis is conducted.
    N (int): Total population size for the SIR model (default: 1000).
    I0 (int): Initial number of infected individuals (default: 1).
    R0 (int): Initial number of recovered individuals (default: 10).
    S0 (int): Initial number of susceptible individuals (calculated as N - I0 - R0).
    y0 (list): Initial values for susceptible (S0), infected (I0), and recovered (R0) individuals.
    gamma (float): Recovery rate in the SIR model (default: 0.1).
    time_points (np.array): Time points over 60 months for which the SIR model is solved.

Returns:
    A plot showing the infected probability over time for each selected country, adjusted using ARIMA-forecasted infection rates.
